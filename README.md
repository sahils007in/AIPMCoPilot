# 🚀 AI Product Manager Copilot

AI Product Manager Copilot is a Generative AI application designed to help Product Managers transform unstructured inputs — such as meeting notes, product ideas, or transcripts — into structured product artifacts like executive summaries, PRDs, action items, and Agile user stories.

👉 Built as a capstone project to demonstrate applied Generative AI workflows and product thinking.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Product Managers frequently deal with messy, unstructured information:

- Meeting transcripts
- Brainstorming notes
- Feature requests
- Stakeholder inputs

Converting this raw information into structured outputs (PRDs, summaries, user stories) is time-consuming and repetitive.

This project explores how AI can accelerate decision-making by automatically structuring product artifacts.
